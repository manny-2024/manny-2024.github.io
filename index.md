## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 3:
This lab was something special for me, because my partner was downloading Linux on his laptop and I was able to figure out how to code the lab on my own and he was helping me making sure that Iâ€™m on track. I was able to use vector and got part 1 complete before the end of class, and it shows that I understand the topic of the class even when I don't have confident

Lab 4
This lab was when we were introduce with loop, which was challenging from getting the code to fun in a loop. I struggle to see where I was making a mistake but I manage to see that it was a simple spelling that made me realise that I need to take thing slowly in oder for things to go well. My partner was making sure that I understand what the lab was asking for and he even told me how the code should work and that he made me to try on my own and only enter to help when I made a mistake and help me to correct it

Lab 11
This final lab was fun and it had everything what we went over in the semester and it had us to review all our lecture note. We opened our preview lab to compare some similarity of how thing was done. I was happy that I completed half of the work of the lab and manage to have time with my partner to work on it later in the week. This lab made me realise that I do understand the topic of the class, and that it showing me that I could still improve for computer scince and that I could be better next time
